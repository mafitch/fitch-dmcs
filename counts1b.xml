<introduction>

<p>If an alphabet has an order, then the strings can be ordered. This is called <term>lexicographic</term> ordering. For words from a language we often call this alphabetical ordering. Because the order on the strings is determined by the order on the alphabet, we call the ordering <term>induced</term>.</p>

<exercise><p>Write all the permutations of the string <q>mat</q>. List them in lexicographic order.</p></exercise>

<exercise><p>The lexicographic order is just one of the orders. How many possible orders of the permutations of the string <q>mat</q> exist?</p></exercise>

<exercise><p>How many possible orders of the permutations of the string <q>math</q> exist?</p></exercise>

<exercise><p>As the length of the string increases, how much does the number of possible orders increase?</p></exercise>
