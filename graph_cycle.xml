	<title>Terminology</title>

<definition>
	<title>Circuit</title>
	<statement><p>A graph is a <term>circuit</term>, or <term>closed walk</term>, if and only if the vertices can be labeled <m>v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_k</m> such that <m>\{v_j,v_{j+1}\}</m> is an edge for all <m>j</m> and <m>v_0=v_k.</m></p></statement>
</definition>

<definition>
	<title>Cycle</title>
	<statement><p>A graph is a <term>cycle</term> if and only if it is a circuit such that no vertex is used twice.</p></statement>
</definition>

<p>A cycle on <m>n</m> vertices is denoted <m>C_n.</m> Likes <term>walk</term> and <term>path</term> terminology for <term>cycles</term> vary widely.</p>

<definition>
	<title>Eulerian Circuit</title>
	<statement><p>A circuit is <term>Eulerian</term> if and only if it uses every edge in the graph and no edge is used twice.</p></statement>
</definition>

<definition>
	<title>Hamiltonian Circuit</title>
	<statement><p>A circuit is <term>Hamiltonian</term> if and only if it uses every vertex in that graph and no edge is used twice.</p></statement>
</definition>
