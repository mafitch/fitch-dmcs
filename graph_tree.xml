	<title>Tree</title>
	<statement><p>A graph is a <term>tree</term> if and only if it is connected and contains no cycles.</p></statement>
</definition>

<definition>
	<title>Leaf</title>
	<statement><p>A vertex in a tree is a <term>leaf</term> if and only if it has degree one.</p></statement>
</definition>

<definition>
	<title>Spanning Tree</title>
	<statement><p>A graph <m>G</m> is a <term>spanning tree</term> of a graph <term>H</term> if and only if <m>G</m> is a subgraph of <m>H</m> that contains all the vertices of <m>H</m> and is a tree.</p></statement>
